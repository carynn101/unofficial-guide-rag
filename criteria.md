# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**

The walking times file has four routes in it, so the Fenwick Court question could pull back the wrong route.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**

The grounding instruction tells the model to name the file every time, so this doesn't depend on luck.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**

My one covered question came back at 0.254 against a 0.6 cutoff, so I expect a clean gap. I'll add the full picture after Milestone 4.

## 4. Something about your chunks

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the answer is contained entirely within a single retrieved chunk rather than split across two.

**Why this target:**

I picked 4 of 5 because my posts average 317 characters and the starter never split one, so most answers should already sit whole inside a chunk.
I left room for one miss in case a post holds two separate thoughts.


---

## 5. Your choice

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the source file the system names actually contains the claim it made.

**Why this target:**

I picked this because my first test answer cited five files when the claim came from one, so I want to check the named source is the real source.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
